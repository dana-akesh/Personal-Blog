                        Climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing our planet today.
                        Rising temperatures, melting ice caps, and unpredictable weather patterns are affecting
                        ecosystems and human lives worldwide.
                        This post discusses the urgency of addressing climate change and what we can all do to help
                        mitigate its impact.

                    <h2>Climate Change in Focus</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Global Warming: The Earth’s average temperature has risen by 1.2 degrees Celsius since the
                            late 19th century, with significant impacts on weather patterns and sea levels.
                        </li>
                        <li>Extreme Weather Events: Heatwaves, hurricanes, and wildfires are becoming more frequent and
                            severe due to climate change, displacing communities and causing widespread damage.
                        </li>
                        <li>Loss of Biodiversity: Rising temperatures and habitat destruction are driving plant and
                            animal species to extinction at an alarming rate, disrupting ecosystems and food chains.
                        </li>
                        <li>Sea Level Rise: Melting ice caps and glaciers are causing sea levels to rise, threatening
                            coastal communities and low-lying islands with flooding and erosion.
                        </li>
                        <li>Human Health Impacts: Climate change is exacerbating health issues like respiratory
                            diseases, heat-related illnesses, and malnutrition, particularly in vulnerable populations.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Governments and organizations worldwide are working to combat climate change, from adopting
                        renewable energy solutions to implementing policies that reduce carbon emissions.
                        But collective action is still needed to slow down the damage and protect future generations.
